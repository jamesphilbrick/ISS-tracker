# ISS-tracker
Returns the altitude and azimuth of the ISS given latitude and longintude input. This data can be used to interface with an arduino to control a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor powered desktop pointer to provide a real time indication of the ISS' location. I did have a time-lapse of a just this with the pointer moving in real time, but I've lost the file :/
